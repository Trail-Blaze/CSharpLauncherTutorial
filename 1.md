# C# FN Launcher Tutorial
## Part 1 - Making the form

1. Create a C# WPF Project, name it whatever you like. I recommend using .NET Core 3.1.
2. Add 3 TextBoxes and 2 Buttons.
3. Put and name them in this order:
- MailTextBox
- PassTextBox
- PathTextBox
- PathBtn
- LaunchBtn
4. Delete the Text content from all TextBoxes.

5. You can add labels on top of the TextBoxes, you don't have to add a name to them.

6. Place everything where you want to, I recommend making it look like this:
